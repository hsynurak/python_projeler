We use this algorithm to find maximum sum of subbaray.
Before this algorithm there is another way; BRUTE FORCE APPROACH.
     This way is not good as kadanes, but it can be helpful for other problems.
     This alternative way start from index 0 and calculate all possible sum of subarrays.
     After this calculation, it founds local maximum values for each starting index.
     Finally compare all this local maximum values and finds global maximum.

For kadane's algorithm create two variable, current_sum and max_sum.
     Assign index zero value to this variables.
     Start from index 1 to last index, compare current_sum and current_sum + current_index_value
     Put the max value of this two values to current_sum variable.
     After checking the current_sum value, compare this current_sum with max_sum value.
     Put the max value of this values to max_sum variable.
